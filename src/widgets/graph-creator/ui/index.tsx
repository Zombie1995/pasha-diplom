Quite loud, but willfully ignored by the crowd\n2. Nobody sees the fire, even though multiple people have clear view through the porous wall to see the fire, or the ambient light.\n3. Nobody reacts to the smell of smoke, even one bit. Have you ever been in a room where someone smells smoke? There is always an instant sniffing patrol and multiple inquires from people curious to know if other people smell smoke too. Because fire scares people and is dangerous.\n4. The way the adult completely ignores the child, while possibly the most plausible, is still a hilarious attempt at justifying the situation for the plot. It is as if he is instructed to not look away from some fixed point. It is natural instinct to address a child's call for attention. \n5. The kid has no visible shock reaction to the initial explosion.\n6. The fire, which seems to be coming from some sort of device connected to the TV like a transformer or a router, has no impact on the TV's function. It continues to work without even cutting the signal.\n7. Multiple conveniently placed mini- extinguishers placed in view of the camera. \n8. The child knows how to operate these, know where they are and executes almost immediately. \n\nLike, c'mon. I can even write out the exact marketing pitch by Temu this was produced on \"Innovative life saving extinguishers so simple that even a child can use it - It can save your life!\" It is so glaringly obvious. There is no context missing in this carefully orchestrated video. Every little clue is served to the viewer. No 2nd angles, out of shot situations, blocking furniture or blurry details.

Magnesium is not self-oxidizing, unlike something like thermite. It's just that Magnesium's affinity for oxygen is stronger than the polar bonds of the water molecule, and the reaction is hot enough that it can break up the molecule on a timescale fast enough to continue the reaction underwater.

They are speaking Scots, but mannerisms and occasional vocabulary from their mother tongues slip into the conversation. The discussion is a debate on the merits of poffertjes versus \u00e6bleskiver, and it grows more heated as it progresses. The discussion devolves into angry and incoherent profanity over a misunderstanding about a false friend word between Danish and Dutch, wherein one speaker is attempting to be friendly without the Scots vocabulary to express himself, and the misconstrues it as a very rude statement.",

Even if it was real and had set on fire multiple times, why would it still be plugged in?\n\n2) Camera angle is conveniently pointed at everything we need to see.\n\n3) Kid is not eating dinner with his family but instead watching tv.\n\n4) Parent doesn't listen to kid when being pulled on, as he is partaking in a toast that happens *right* after the fire starts. Everyone was also super ready for the toast which seems odd.\n\n5) Fire extinguisher is located right under the tv, and the kid knows how to use it immediately. You could say maybe they have it from the previous fires, but again *why* would it still be plugged in if it was ever on fire??\n\n6) The whole scene is just perfect for making a heartwarming story and a viral video.\n\nI would say any of these things could easily happen on their own, but the fact that they all happen at once and nothing goes wrong makes it obvious that this video was extremely likely to be staged.

    body: "We had a pretty big fire in our kitchen (parents had left stuff the the stove\u2026 dog had jumped up and turned on the stovetop with her paw accidentally\u2026 so things on the stove caught on fire. I only saw the flicker of the flame when it got big enough to catch my eye from another room where I was playing games on my computer.\n\nI was NOT calm. My mom was upstairs studying with my sister and I SCREAMED for her. \u201cMom!! FIRE!!\u201d And she goes \u201cI\u2019ll be down in a minute\u201d (with no urgency). I start pleading \u201cmom, NO, fire!! You need to come now!\u201d This went on for like 20 seconds, me running upstairs to grab her and saying no it\u2019s real, you have to come, etc. \n\nShe looked so annoyed with me, having to stop reviewing flash cards with my sister. She begrudgingly followed me to the kitchen. As soon as she saw the flame (a few feet tall, almost touching the cabinets above) her eyes lit with urgency and she sprang into action.\n\nI was too scared/paralyzed to know what to do with the fire but it still annoys me how close we got to our kitchen/house burning down because she didn\u2019t believe me.",

He said wait a minute so I sat on the bottom step and waited a few minutes. Once he came out I told him \u201cthe oven is on fire\u201d. Naturally he ran upstairs in a panic and we had a chat later that those rules can be ignored in case of emergency. So while this might be a fake video, I can imagine it happening",

We were in the water, I was at chest deep level and they, being much taller, were likely at waist or thigh-deep level.\n\nSuddenly the water receded very strongly and I was on the ground, and I felt the force of it trying to suck me away. I was grabbing at their feet, begging for help, and they just kept talking to each other. I tried clawing at their feet, hoping the pain would make them look down, and a long time later, they stopped talking to look down, and one of them helped me up and told me I was exaggerating. The water came back soon after.\n\nI was about 6-7. I definitely was not strong enough, even if the sea was mild that day. They just didn't realize the difference between themselves and me, I suppose.\n\nI think adults with kids eventually learn to tune out the kids' chatter, because otherwise they go nuts.

That\u2019s quite a feat. How you can extrapolate any commonality among that many individuals beyond their browsing habits is beyond me.\n\nLet's talk about 'true colors.' The phrase suggests some hidden, essential nature that gets revealed under certain conditions.

Even if their reply did fit the criteria of showing their 'true colors,' it reveals nothing profound about the entire user base\u2014it's just confirmation bias at its finest.\n\nSo next time, instead of resorting to tired clich\u00e9s and broad-brush insults, maybe consider the diversity of the platform and the complexity of human nature.

Looks like the adults are drinking. Could very well all be pretty drunk as it is. Ignoring events around you is super common when drunk. \n\n4) kid being responsible and handling business himself? Absolutely common especially from households that force kids to grow up. Older kids are absolutely forced to grow up quickly and take care of their younger siblings, even if they\u2019re only a few years older and not even in their teens yet. So they have to be the mature ones doing things an adult should be doing because the adults in their lives suck. \n\nAgain, while this particular clip could be staged, nothing in it is unrealistic for people who had to be that kid taking care of an emergency when adults couldn\u2019t be fucked to do it.",

We lost that house because the firefighters ignored the fucking river they crossed to get there, but I'm still miffed they didn't even write down what I said, just ignored it until later look at the recording showed them wrong to dismiss me completely. \n\nSure, asking adult to verify was good move... but completely dismissing what I said? bad move. \n\nsure the asbestos in the walls made the house a bit more unliveable too but that's not our or firefighters or the operators or moms fault, but fault of the guy who made the house and didn't write it all down correctly",
